# Rules

⚠️ The 2026 ruleset is currently under development. This repository will be updated as rules progress is made.

This repository contains the sources of the rule book for the Robot Soccer League.
The main document is `Rules.tex`.
It should be regarded as an insight into the rule book's development process, but not as a normative document.
There is no guarantee that changes made in this version will actually appear in the final rule book.

## Official Rules
The official rule book releases can be found on (TBA).
