# Rules

This repository contains the sources of the rule book for the Robot Soccer League.
The main document is `Rules.tex`.
It should be regarded as an insight into the rule book's development process, but not as a normative document.
There is no guarantee that changes made in this version will actually appear in the final rule book.

## Official Rules
The official rule book releases can be found on (TBA).
