\section{Purpose and Scope of the \leaguename}
\label{sec:introduction}

This document defines the purpose, scope, and rules of the \leaguename for the international RoboCup competition, at the forefront of research, innovation, and education in humanoid soccer across all forms.

\subsection{Vision and Mission Statement}
\label{sec:vision_and_mission}

%TW: This is the vision statment developed by the former SPL teams
The \leaguename~(\leaguenameabbr) will drive innovative research that advances the software of autonomous robots with a particular emphasis on robots deployed in real-time, dynamic, partially observable, and multi-agent environments.
The \leaguenameabbr is well suited to advance research in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-robot systems (5+ robots) requiring decentralized coordination with limited communication over noisy channels.
    \item Localization and state-estimation.
    \item Dynamic humanoid motor control.
    \item Real-time and on-board robot perception.
    \item Across topics, robot learning in all its forms.
    \item Software engineering for autonomous robots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Vision and Requirements for Legal Standard Robot Platforms}

The \leaguenameabbr encourages and welcomes the use of standard humanoid robot platforms available within the market to advance the state of humanoid robot soccer and the vision of the \leaguenameabbr.

With the \leaguenameabbr vision in mind, the core requirements for standard humanoid platforms used within the \leaguenameabbr are platforms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Capable of dynamic motions such as fast walking, kicking a ball off the ground, and getting up from the ground;
    \item Capable of running state-of-the-art AI neural network models for perception, decision-making, and control;
    \item Sufficiently small and affordable that teams can fund multiple robots and travel with them to competitions;
    \item Able to be programmed at a low-level of control;
    \item Well-Documented.
\end{enumerate}
