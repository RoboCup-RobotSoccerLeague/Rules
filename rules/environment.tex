\subsubsection{Lighting Conditions}
The \leaguenameabbr does not mandate specific or controlled lighting conditions for a match venue. It is expected that the venue provides reasonable lighting \improvement{is more definition needed for what is "reasonable"?} suitable for general visibility (\eg indoor with artificial lighting, outdoor with natural lighting, or a combination of both). This lighting may include variations such as glare, brightness, shadows, or mixed lighting conditions that can change throughout the match. However, the lighting must be predominantly white, and colored lighting that significantly changes the perceived color of the field or ball is not allowed. Teams participating in the \leaguenameabbr are encouraged to design their robots to handle a variety of typical lighting environments that may be encountered during a match. \improvement{to be discussed, add more details if needed}
