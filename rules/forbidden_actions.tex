\subsection{Leaving the Field}
\label{sec:leaving_the_field}
Robots must remain inside the field (see Section~\ref{sec:field}) during play, except as permitted by specific rules (e.g., during specific set-plays that allow leaving the field, or returning from a penalized state). If a robot is outside the field but is actively and clearly attempting to return, temporary lenience may be granted. However, if there is no clear intent to return, the robot is considered to be \textit{leaving the field} and may be penalized accordingly. \unsure{Should this be stricter for larger robot divisions as they pose a greater threat if leaving the field} Illegal positioning also occurs when a robot is not in its designated area during set plays. \todo{Further clarify illegal positioning and consequences. Will refer to SPL/HL rules for inspiration.}
